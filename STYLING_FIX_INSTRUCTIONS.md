# WordPress Styling Issue - Root Cause & Solution

## Problem Identified

WordPress **strips `<style>` tags** from post content for security reasons. Your styled HTML with the magazine CSS is being saved, but WordPress removes the `<style>` block, leaving only unstyled HTML.

## Evidence
- Logs show: Components inserted ✓
- Logs show: CSS formatted ✓
- Logs show: Article assembled ✓
- WordPress receives the content ✓
- **BUT**: WordPress strips the `<style>` tag on save

## Solutions

### Option 1: Add CSS to WordPress Theme (Recommended)
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Appearance → Customize → Additional CSS
2. Paste the magazine CSS there
3. It will apply to ALL posts automatically

### Option 2: Use Inline Styles (Fallback)
Modify `magazine_formatter.py` to add critical styles inline on each element.

### Option 3: Custom Field + Code Snippet
1. Save CSS as post meta
2. Add WordPress snippet to inject it in `<head>`

## Immediate Fix

**I recommend Option 1**: Add the CSS to your WordPress theme.

The CSS is already generated correctly with your brand colors. It just needs to be in WordPress theme CSS instead of post content.

### Steps:
1. Login to WordPress admin (https://ezwai.com/wp-admin)
2. Go to **Appearance → Customize**
3. Click **Additional CSS**
4. Paste the generated CSS (I'll provide it)
5. Click **Publish**

After that, all your articles will have proper styling!

Would you like me to:
A) Generate the CSS for you to paste into WordPress
B) Modify the code to use inline styles instead
C) Implement the custom field solution
