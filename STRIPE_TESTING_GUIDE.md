# Stripe Payment Testing Guide - Complete Setup

**For:** Local development and testing before deployment
**System:** EZWAI SMM Credit System

## üìã What is a Stripe Webhook and Why Do You Need It?

### What Is It?

A **webhook** is like a phone call from Stripe to your application. When something important happens (like a payment succeeding), Stripe "calls" your server with the details.

### Why You Need It

**Your credit system works like this:**

1. **User clicks "Buy Credits"** ‚Üí Opens Stripe checkout page
2. **User enters payment info** ‚Üí Stripe processes payment
3. **‚úÖ Payment succeeds** ‚Üí Stripe sends webhook to your server
4. **Your server receives webhook** ‚Üí Adds credits to user's account
5. **User gets credits** ‚Üí Can create articles

**Without webhooks:** You'd never know the payment succeeded, so credits wouldn't be added!

### What's the Webhook Secret?

The **webhook secret** is like a password that proves the webhook really came from Stripe (not a hacker pretending to be Stripe).

---

## üéØ Your Current Setup

### Webhook Endpoint in Your Code

**File:** [app_v3.py:1056](app_v3.py#L1056)

```python
@app.route('/webhook/stripe', methods=['POST'])
def stripe_webhook():
    """Handle Stripe webhook events"""

    # 1. Get the webhook secret
    webhook_secret = os.getenv('STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET')

    # 2. Verify the webhook is real
    event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
        payload, sig_header, webhook_secret
    )

    # 3. Handle different events
    if event_type == 'checkout.session.completed':
        # Payment successful! Add credits
        handle_checkout_completed(session)
```

### Events Your App Handles

```python
‚úÖ checkout.session.completed  # User completed payment
‚úÖ payment_intent.succeeded     # Payment went through
‚ùå payment_intent.payment_failed # Payment failed
‚úÖ setup_intent.succeeded       # Payment method saved
```

## üöÄ Option 1: Stripe CLI (Recommended for Local Testing)

This is the **easiest way** to test webhooks on localhost!

### Step 1: Install Stripe CLI

**Windows (Download):**
1. Go to: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest
2. Download: `stripe_X.X.X_windows_x86_64.zip`
3. Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\stripe\`)
4. Add to PATH or navigate to folder in terminal

**Windows (Scoop):**
```bash
scoop bucket add stripe https://github.com/stripe/scoop-stripe-cli.git
scoop install stripe
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
stripe --version
# Should show: stripe version X.X.X
```

### Step 2: Login to Stripe

```bash
stripe login
```

**What happens:**
1. Opens browser
2. Shows "Stripe CLI wants to access your account"
3. Click "Allow access"
4. Terminal shows "‚úì Done! The Stripe CLI is configured"

### Step 3: Forward Webhooks to Localhost

**Start your Flask app first:**
```bash
python app_v3.py
# App running on http://localhost:5000
```

**In another terminal, forward webhooks:**
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/webhook/stripe
```

**Output:**
```
> Ready! You are using Stripe API Version [2024-XX-XX]
> Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**üìã COPY THE SECRET!** It looks like: `whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

### Step 4: Update .env File

```bash
# Edit .env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Restart your Flask app** to load the new secret.

### Step 5: Test It!

**Keep both terminals running:**
- Terminal 1: `python app_v3.py` (Flask app)
- Terminal 2: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/webhook/stripe`

**Trigger a test event:**
```bash
# In a THIRD terminal
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

**You'll see:**
```
Terminal 2 (Stripe CLI):
‚úì [200] POST http://localhost:5000/webhook/stripe

Terminal 1 (Flask app):
[Stripe] Received event: checkout.session.completed
[Stripe] Added $10.00 credits to user 1
```

‚úÖ **It works!**

## üåê Option 2: ngrok (Public Tunnel)

Use this if you want to test with the **real Stripe dashboard** or share with others.

### Step 1: Install ngrok

**Download:**
1. Go to: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Sign up for free account
3. Download ngrok for Windows
4. Extract to folder

**Setup:**
```bash
# Get your auth token from: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

### Step 2: Start Tunnel

**Start Flask app:**
```bash
python app_v3.py
```

**Start ngrok:**
```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

**Output:**
```
Forwarding   https://abc123.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:5000
```

**üìã COPY THE URL!** It looks like: `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`

### Step 3: Configure Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click "**Add endpoint**"
3. **Endpoint URL:** `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/webhook/stripe`
4. **Events to send:**
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `setup_intent.succeeded`
5. Click "**Add endpoint**"

### Step 4: Get Webhook Secret

**After creating endpoint:**
1. Click on the endpoint you just created
2. Click "**Reveal**" under "Signing secret"
3. **üìã COPY THE SECRET!** Looks like: `whsec_xxxxxx...`

### Step 5: Update .env

```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Restart Flask app** to load the secret.

   # Use TEST keys for development
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51QuaBV...
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51QuaBV...
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx  # From Stripe CLI or Dashboard
   ```

4. **Restart everything:**
   ```bash

## üîç Debugging Common Issues

### Issue: "Webhook secret not configured"

**Symptom:**
```
[Stripe] Webhook secret not configured
```

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env` has `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
2. Restart Flask app
3. Verify: `python -c "import os; from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); print(os.getenv('STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET'))"`

### Issue: "Invalid signature"

**Symptom:**
```
[Stripe] Invalid signature: ...
```

**Fix:**
1. Webhook secret doesn't match
2. Get fresh secret from `stripe listen` output
3. Update `.env`
4. Restart Flask

### Issue: "Credits not added"

**Symptom:**
- Payment succeeds but credits don't increase

**Fix:**
1. Check Terminal 1 (Flask) for errors
2. Verify webhook endpoint receiving events: `stripe listen --print-json`
3. Check `handle_checkout_completed` function logs
4. Verify user_id in session metadata

### Issue: Webhook not receiving events

**Symptom:**
- Stripe CLI shows no webhook calls

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test the endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/webhook/stripe
# Should return error (no signature) but confirms endpoint exists

# Check Flask routes
python -c "from app_v3 import app; print([str(rule) for rule in app.url_map.iter_rules()])"
# Should include: /webhook/stripe
```

## üìä Your Webhook Endpoint Details

**URL:** `http://localhost:5000/webhook/stripe`
**Method:** POST
**File:** [app_v3.py:1056](app_v3.py#L1056)

**Events Handled:**
| Event | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| `checkout.session.completed` | Adds credits to user account |
| `payment_intent.succeeded` | Logs successful payment |
| `payment_intent.payment_failed` | Logs failed payment |
| `setup_intent.succeeded` | Saves payment method for auto-recharge |

**What Happens When Webhook Received:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify signature (prevents fraud)
2. ‚úÖ Parse event type
3. ‚úÖ Add credits to user's account (via `add_credits_manual`)
4. ‚úÖ Update `credit_balance` in database
5. ‚úÖ Send confirmation email to user
6. ‚úÖ Return 200 OK to Stripe

---

## üéØ Production Deployment (Later)

When you deploy to a server, you'll need to:

### 1. Use Live Keys
```bash
# .env (production)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_51QuaBV...  # Your real key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51QuaBV...
```

### 2. Configure Webhook in Stripe Dashboard
```
URL: https://yourdomain.com/webhook/stripe
Events: Same as test mode
```

### 3. Get Production Webhook Secret
```
Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Your endpoint ‚Üí Reveal secret
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
```

**Note:** Production and test webhooks have **different secrets!**
