## SendGrid Configuration

**Requirements**:
- SendGrid API key (EMAIL_PASSWORD in .env)
- Verified sender: joe@ezwai.com
- Attachment support enabled (default)

**Attachment Specs**:
- Format: text/html
- Encoding: base64
- Disposition: attachment
- Max size: 30 MB (SendGrid limit, our files are 8-10 MB)

## User Benefits

1. **Never Miss an Article**: Email arrives even if user closes browser
2. **Multi-Platform Distribution**: Easy to share on LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.
3. **Offline Access**: Can view/share article without internet (local mode)
4. **Professional Archiving**: Keep portfolio of generated articles
5. **Team Collaboration**: Forward email or share HTML file with colleagues
6. **Flexible Publishing**: Can publish to WordPress OR other platforms

## Technical Details

### Filename Generation

```python
# Sanitize title for filename
safe_filename = "".join(c for c in title if c.isalnum() or c in (' ', '-', '_')).strip()
safe_filename = safe_filename[:50]  # Limit to 50 characters
safe_filename = f"{safe_filename}.html" if safe_filename else "article.html"
```

### Base64 Encoding

```python
# Encode article HTML for email attachment
article_bytes = article_html.encode('utf-8')
article_base64 = base64.b64encode(article_bytes).decode('utf-8')
```

### Error Handling

- Email send failures are logged but don't block article creation
- Users see warning: "Post created, but email notification failed to send"
- Article is still accessible via WordPress dashboard
- Full stack trace logged for debugging

## Testing

To test email notifications:

### Test WordPress Mode

```python
from email_notification import send_article_notification_with_attachment

send_article_notification_with_attachment(
    title="Test Article Title",
    article_html=article_html_content,  # Full HTML string
    hero_image_url="https://example.com/hero.jpg",
    user_email="test@example.com",
    mode="wordpress",
    wordpress_url="https://yoursite.com",
    post_id=123
)
```

### Test Local Mode

```python
send_article_notification_with_attachment(
    title="Test Article Title",
    article_html=article_html_content,  # Full HTML with base64 images
    hero_image_url="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ...",
    user_email="test@example.com",
    mode="local"
)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **PDF Attachments**: Option to attach article as PDF in addition to HTML
2. **Preview Images**: Include hero image inline in email body
3. **Download Links**: Alternative to attachment for large files
4. **Scheduling Confirmation**: Send notification when scheduled post is queued
5. **Weekly Digest**: Summary of all articles created that week
6. **Social Media Integration**: Direct post to LinkedIn API from email

### Configuration Options

Future user settings in dashboard:
- Enable/disable email notifications
- Choose attachment format (HTML, PDF, both)
- Email frequency (immediate, daily digest, weekly)
- Include/exclude attachment
- Custom email template

## Cost Impact

**No Additional Cost**: SendGrid pricing based on email count, not attachment size
- Current plan supports attachments up to 30 MB
- Our typical attachments: 8-10 MB (local mode) or ~100 KB (WordPress mode)
- No change to existing SendGrid subscription needed

## Security Considerations

1. **Email Validation**: User emails validated during registration
2. **Attachment Safety**: HTML files are safe to open in browsers
3. **Content Sanitization**: Article HTML is generated by trusted AI pipeline
4. **No External Resources**: Local mode articles are fully self-contained
5. **WordPress Links**: Direct links include post ID but require WordPress login

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received

**Check**:
1. SendGrid API key is valid (EMAIL_PASSWORD in .env)
2. Sender email is verified: joe@ezwai.com
3. Recipient email is correct in user account
4. Check spam/junk folder
5. Review logs for SendGrid response code

### Attachment Too Large

**Issue**: SendGrid 30 MB limit
**Solution**:
- WordPress mode: Uses external images (~100 KB)
- Local mode: Base64 images (~8-10 MB, well under limit)

### Formatting Lost on Copy/Paste

**Issue**: Some platforms strip CSS
**Solution**:
- HTML uses inline styles for maximum compatibility
- Most major platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook, Gmail) preserve formatting
- If issues persist, user can publish WordPress version
